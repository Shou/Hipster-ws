Hipster-ws
==========

A workspace indicator much like the ones you find in tiling window managers, for the hipster pseudo-NEET scum who loves retro looks.

Something of note is that it works along with the "Status title bar" extension.

## Styling

It only has two classes,
* `.hipster-ws`

For workspaces that aren't visible.

* `hipster-ws-current`

For the currently visible workspace.
